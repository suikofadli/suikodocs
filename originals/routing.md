# Routing

## Defining routes

When using Inertia, all of your application's routes are defined server-side. This means that you don't need Vue Router or React Router. Instead, you can simply define Laravel routes and return [Inertia responses](/responses) from those routes.

## Shorthand routes

If you have a [page](/pages) that doesn't need a corresponding controller method, like an "FAQ" or "about" page, you can route directly to a component via the `Route::inertia()` method.

Laravel:

```php
Route::inertia('/about', 'About');
```

## Generating URLs

Some server-side frameworks allow you to generate URLs from named routes. However, you will not have access to those helpers client-side. Here are a couple ways to still use named routes with Inertia.

The first option is to generate URLs server-side and include them as props. Notice in this example how we're passing the `edit_url` and `create_url` to the `Users/Index` component.

Laravel:

```php
class UsersController extends Controller
{
public function index()
{
return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
'users' => User::all()->map(function ($user) {
return [
'id' => $user->id,
'name' => $user->name,
'email' => $user->email,
'edit_url' => route('users.edit', $user),
];
}),
'create_url' => route('users.create'),
]);
}
}
```

However, when using Laravel, the [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) library can make your named, server-side routes available to you via a global `route()` function. In fact, if you are developing an application using one of Laravel's [starter kits](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits), Ziggy is already configured for you.

If you're using the Vue plugin included with Ziggy, you may use the `route()` function directly in your templates.

```html
<Link :href="route('users.create')">Create User</Link>
```

When [server-side rendering](/server-side-rendering) is enabled, you may pass an options object to the Ziggy plugin in your `ssr.js` file. This should include the route definitions and current location.

```js
.use(ZiggyVue, {
...page.props.ziggy,
location: new URL(page.props.ziggy.location),
});
```

## Customizing the Page URL

The [page object](/the-protocol#the-page-object) includes a `url` that represents the current page's URL. By default, the Laravel adapter resolves this using the `fullUrl()` method on the `Request` instance, but strips the scheme and host so the result is a relative URL.

If you need to customize how the URL is resolved, you may provide a resolver within the `urlResolver`method of the Inertia `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware.

```php
class HandleInertiaRequests extends Middleware
{
public function urlResolver()
{
return function (Request $request) {
// Return the URL for the request...
};
}
}
```

Alternatively, you may define the resolver using the `Inertia::resolveUrlUsing()` method.

```php
Inertia::resolveUrlUsing(function (Request $request) {
// Return the URL for the request...
});
```
